    "text": "Houpu Wang grew up in Nanshan District, Shenzhen. He attended 南头城小学 for elementary school, 南山实验教育集团麒麟中学 for middle school (Class 12), and 盐田高级中学 for high school (Class 4). In 2024, he graduated from 北京工商大学 with a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design. During his undergraduate studies, he developed strong skills in 3D modeling, product structure, material research, manufacturing processes, ergonomics, and physical product logic. He participated in multiple student design teams and worked on projects including a community waste classification system and children's interactive toys. He received awards including the Beijing 'Challenge Cup' Gold Prize and the National 'Internet+' Third Prize.\n\nDuring undergraduate years, he served as a department head in the student union. He was responsible for official public account writing, traditional festival feature articles, and behind-the-scenes planning for debate competitions and academic experience-sharing events. He is skilled in writing, visual layout, poster design, and dynamic PowerPoint storytelling. These experiences strengthened both his narrative capability and communication skills.\n\nCurrently, he is pursuing an MFA in Interaction Design at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York, expected to graduate in 2026. His academic shift marks a transition from physical product design to system interaction and intelligent product ecosystems. At SVA, his projects involve AI and human-computer interaction, service design, system logic construction, physical computing (Arduino), interface prototyping, XR environments, and speculative future interaction systems. He has served as a Course Assistant for Physical Computing, Smart Object, and Thesis Presentation courses, reflecting recognition of his technical and communication abilities."

    "text": "From August 2025 to January 2026, Houpu worked as the Founding Designer at Vicino.AI and was the first employee to join the company. He took on multiple responsibilities including defining the core product form (a multimedia canvas-based AI node generation system), designing and iterating the official website (two major versions), creating branding and logo identity, producing motion design promotional videos, building the design system, recruiting new designers, and mentoring team members. His role required both strategic product thinking and hands-on execution across visual, interaction, and system design."

    "text": "One of Houpu's major projects is a wearable system addressing chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. He identified fragmentation in chronic disease management, where daily monitoring, medical consultation, medication reminders, and emergency intervention exist in separate systems. He also observed low medication success rates in inhalation devices. His solution integrates monitoring and intervention into a wristband-based ecosystem that includes a detachable inhalation module. The system provides abnormal detection, behavioral reminders, medication integration, and long-term data continuity. It emphasizes behavioral continuity and closed-loop system logic rather than isolated functions. The device uses an innovative semi-mechanical and semi-electronic structure to ensure stable medication delivery in all scenarios. It also incorporates inclusive design principles, ensuring the device does not become a visible medical label for patients.\n\nAnother project focuses on temporomandibular disorder (TMD). This work is grounded in personal and peer experience: Houpu wore a jaw pad in high school for treatment and experienced recurring symptoms, and his university roommate also struggled with TMD with limited access to professional treatment in China. The design aims to integrate therapeutic support into daily life rather than creating a separated medical device. It emphasizes ergonomics, material exploration, long-term wear comfort, and emotional support.\n\nAt SVA, he participated in a service design project for the MoMA PS1 Bookstore. The project examined how digital systems can enhance engagement in a public cultural space while preserving the uniqueness of the physical environment.\n\nDuring undergraduate years, Houpu also founded 第六元素设计工作室, designing and producing Gundam accessories, anime merchandise, and metal models. He developed a small program for the studio and created posters and mini-program interfaces for a friend's coffee shop. Other projects include a metal fatigue monitoring system using nonlinear ultrasonic methods and predictive modeling for structural fatigue visualization, and an AI interactive book integrating physical reading with adaptive digital feedback. He also contributed to the 北京后北营 community waste classification system, focusing on behavioral guidance and public participation."

He is the second author of an SCI paper on nonlinear ultrasonic fatigue damage detection published in the journal 'Materials.' He is particularly strong at integrating physical product logic with interaction system logic."

    "text": "Houpu's life path spans Shenzhen, Beijing, and New York, representing a transition from manufacturing-driven environments to academic design contexts and then to experimental interaction design ecosystems. This geographic and cultural movement shaped both his engineering thinking and conceptual exploration ability. He values close relationships but prefers to keep emotional status confidential. He frequently reflects on personal maturity and long-term relational stability, and this reflective mindset also influences his design process. He maintains high standards for design quality, prioritizing system structure over surface-level interaction."
